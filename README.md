Frogger game clone
==================

This is a HTML canvas game, developed under guidance of [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com) Frontend Nanodegree cource.

## How to begin
The game code is being hosted on my github pages, which can be reached [here](http://briskr.github.io/udacity-frogger/index.html).

You can also clone the code, then open `index.html` in your browser.

## Game control

Move up until you reach the river.

Use arrow keys to move around to avoid colliding with the moving bugs.

## System requirements

This game should be able to run in most mainstream browsers with `canvas` support, on mobile or desktop platform
